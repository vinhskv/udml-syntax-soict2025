# Long version: technical report 

Due to page limitations in the paper, we provide a detailed description in the technical report (`techRep.pdf`), which presents the experiments conducted on the support tool.

This work represents a significant effort to leverage the **JetBrains MPS** platform for specifying the syntax of **UDML**.  
We implemented the approach using the *CourseMan* example with the following components:

## Components

- **Instructor**  
  Defines the metaconcepts for UDML and concern-specific DSLs.  

- **Editor**  
  Defines a graphical concrete syntax enabling drag-and-drop functionality.  

- **Generator**  
  Defines the semantics for transforming the AST model created by concern DSLs into executable source code embedded within the JDA framework.  

## Evaluation
In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method and discuss the results obtained.
